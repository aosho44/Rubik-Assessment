## FSB Assessment

We were given a set of task that had to be automated using WebdriverIO or Selenium. I chose to do it on WebdriverIO

### Scenario:

> Go to google site
> 
> Search for the keyword 'Test Automation Learning'
> 
> Select the link with Udemy course
> 
> Verify if the Udemy site has opened
> 
> Search for BDD with Cucumber
> 
> Click on the course with highest rating from the list of search results

### Issues

The issues I came across during this assessment was the captcha and the website breaking down on me multiple times until the search bar was rendered useless. It prevented me from being able to complete the final task which was to **"Click on the course with highest rating from the list of search results"**. I tried finding ways to complete the final step by inspecting the elements and then writing the code based on how I want it to behave but like stated above, the search bar refused to work with me. Manually and automated
